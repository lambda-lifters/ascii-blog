== What's New in Bootstrap 5?

Bootstrap 5 brings significant improvements over its predecessors, making it easier than ever to build modern, responsive websites. The biggest change? *No more jQuery dependency!*

== Key Features

Bootstrap 5's grid system is more flexible than ever:

[source,html]

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">
      <!-- Content automatically adjusts -->
    </div>
  </div>

The new `.g-*` classes make gutter control much easier, and the addition of `.row-cols-*` classes simplifies equal-width columns.

=== Enhanced Forms

  <label for="floatingInput">Email address</label>
</div>
----

Bootstrap 5 introduces a powerful Utilities API that lets you create custom utility classes:

* Spacing utilities with new values

* Extended color palette
* Custom properties for theming

== Performance Improvements

Bootstrap 5 is faster and lighter:

* Smaller file size without jQuery
