== Why Go Static?

In an era of complex web applications, static site generators (SSGs) are experiencing a renaissance. They offer simplicity, security, and blazing-fast performance that dynamic sites struggle to match.

== Benefits of Static Sites

=== Lightning-Fast Performance

Static sites serve pre-built HTML files directly:

* No database queries
* No server-side processing
* Easy CDN distribution
* Instant page loads

NOTE: A well-optimized static site can achieve perfect Lighthouse scores with minimal effort.

=== Unmatched Security

With no server-side code or database:

* No SQL injection vulnerabilities
* No server-side exploits
* Minimal attack surface
* Simple security model

=== Cost-Effective Hosting

Static sites can be hosted almost anywhere:

[source,bash]
----
# Deploy to GitHub Pages
git push origin main

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod

# Deploy to S3
aws s3 sync ./public s3://my-bucket
----

Many hosting options are completely free for static sites!

== Popular Static Site Generators

=== Jekyll
* Ruby-based, GitHub Pages native support
* Great for blogs and documentation
* Large ecosystem of themes and plugins

=== Hugo
* Go-based, incredibly fast builds
* Built-in asset pipeline
* Excellent for large sites

=== Next.js
* React-based with static export
* Hybrid static/dynamic capabilities
* Modern development experience

=== 11ty (Eleventy)
* JavaScript-based, zero-config philosophy
* Flexible templating options
* Growing community

== The JAMstack Architecture

Static sites fit perfectly into the JAMstack:

**J**avaScript:: Dynamic functionality via client-side JS
**A**PIs:: Server-side processes abstracted into APIs
**M**arkup:: Pre-built markup served from CDN

== Conclusion

Static site generators offer a compelling solution for many web projects. They provide excellent performance, security, and developer experience while keeping hosting costs minimal.

By choosing the right SSG and architecture for your needs, you can build sites that are fast, secure, and maintainable. The future of web development isn't always dynamic - sometimes, static is exactly what you need.
